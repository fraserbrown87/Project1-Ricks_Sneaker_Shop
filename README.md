# Ricks Sneaker Shop

A stock tracking app that allows the user check and update inventory for different brands and styles for a Sneaker Store. This serves as a useful tool for small businesses.



## Built with:

Ruby - object orientated programming language
HTML - markup language
CSS - style language
SQL - database language
Sinatra - web framework used
Postrgres - an object-relational database management system

### Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To run this web app, you will need to be able to require:

Sinatra
Postrgres
Ruby

### Installing

Create a database called ricks_sneaker_shop
Run the database and SQL file by typing: psql -d ricks_sneaker_shop -f db/ricks_sneaker_shop.SQL
Run the seeds.rb, also situated in the db folder
Run the app.rb using port: 4567
Open the localhost:4567/ in your URL


### Motivation

This web app was created as part of a week long project undertaken while attending CodeClan's 16-week intensive course. At the beginning of the week, we were given four briefs to choose from in which we would implement, consolidate and expand on everything we'd learnt so far.

This included:

Ruby fundamentals
TDD (where appropriate)
OOP
Web Programming (REST/MVC)
Databases with CRUD actions

Despite some interesting briefs, I had an idea for a stock tracking app. As I have a background in fashion and retail I think this would be a useful app to use.
